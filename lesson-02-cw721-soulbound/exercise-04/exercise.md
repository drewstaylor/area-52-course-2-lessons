Title: Non-transferable NFTs Part 2

> There's no food or water in this room. Yeah, you're cyberdized, but it's only a matter of time before your lingering biology causes you to starve. It seems there'll be no "get-out-of-jail-free" card in this dangerous game. Now, it’s a race against the clock.

Great! Our soulbound system is coming together now. There are just two more files we need to update. Hurry up and you can get yourself back to the home planet without missing lunch.

### Cosmos Actor Model

Cosmos uses the Actor Model, where "actors" do not talk directly with each other (i.e., do not call functions directly) but rather send messages to one another. So, next we'll need to remove the message types for NFT ownership transfers.

If you need a refresher on Cosmos messages, and the Actor Model, have a look at [this exercise](https://area-52.io/starting-with-cosm-wasm/1/returning-the-value-of-instantiate) from the [first course](https://area-52.io/starting-with-cosm-wasm).

# Exercise

Remove the message types for `TransferNft` and `SendNft` from the `ExecuteMsg` enum. Additionally, take some time to review the comments in this file as it lists and explains everything CosmWasm NFTs can do.
