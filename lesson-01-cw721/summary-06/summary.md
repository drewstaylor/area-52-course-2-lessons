# Overview

In this lesson we looked at the [cw721](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md) standard for CosmWasm NFTs, and its relationship to [cw721-base](https://crates.io/crates/cw721-base) which is a basic implementation of a `cw721` NFT contract.

In general, we learned about:

- The entry points and functions provided by `cw721` as implemented in `cw721-base`
- How to mint NFTs with `cw721-base`
- `cw721` with off-chain metadata
- Creating a token collection contract
